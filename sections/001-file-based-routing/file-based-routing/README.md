# File Based Routing

## Why it's important

Plain and simple, Next.js allows the developer to create routing in a way that asks for no fuss or extra
third party libraries (e.g. react-router). It requires no extra code outside of when using the Link component, which removes an entire step of getting the initial skeleton of the project set-up.

## What I learned in this Section

- Rendering a component at the base url ('/pages/index.js')
- Rendering another page given a simple extra url path ('/pages/about.js')
- Dynamic paths and nested page routes ('/pages/portfolio')
- Catch-all routes ('/pages/blog')
- Nested dynamic paths, useRouter and programatic navigation ('/pages/clients')
