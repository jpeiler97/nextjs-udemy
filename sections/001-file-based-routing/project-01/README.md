# File Based Routing Project - Events Page

## Overview

A barebones website with dummy data simulating a site for seeing coding events. The purpose of the project is to get familiar with working with routes and components, but Max also introduces the concept of CSS Modules and some other Next JS tips. Creating components in Next.JS is distinct from React in that the file conventions of Next.JS require you to keep components in a separate directory from pages. 

While I'm not unfamiliar with CSS Modules, it's a good refresher. It's no surprise they're supported by Next.js by default, as they're an easy way to manage styling in a a production-scale app with a large amount of components. Each CSS module only pertains to the ones that it is imported and used in, and each class name gets overriden to be unique to a component in the background. 

## What I learned in this Project

- Where to place components ('/components')
- CSS Modules (various files)
- Rendering fetched data (albeit, fake data in this project) (various files)
- Styling a Link component with a class name ('components/ui/Button.js')
