# Optimizing Next.JS

## How Next.JS allows easy optimization for your app

This section was small but important. A big feature of Next.JS is its ability out of the box to optimize your app as needed. For one, it gives the ability to optimize metadata for individual pages (considering each page is its own HTML doc) using the Head component. The entire document can also be modified using \_document.js, and default metadata can be set up in \_app.js. Next.JS also allows the optimization of images using the Image component, in place of the img tag.

## What I learned in this Section

- Head tag ('./\_app.js', './events')
- Modifying the document with \_document.js
- Adding default Head data ('./index.js')
- Image component for optimization ('../components/event-detail/event-logistics.js')
